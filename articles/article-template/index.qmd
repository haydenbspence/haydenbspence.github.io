# Welcome to My Personal Site

This is a **test page** to ensure our Tufte-inspired light and dark themes are working correctly.  

## Typography Test

Here’s how the **typography** renders in different elements:

- **Bold Text:** This is **bold** text.
- *Italicized Text:* This is *italicized* text.
- `Inline Code:` Here’s `inline code` using JetBrains Mono.

```r
# Code block example (R)
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
mean(x)
```

```python
# Code block example (Python)
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
average = sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
print(average)
```
